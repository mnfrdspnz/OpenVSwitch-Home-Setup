# Case Studies and Examples

## Example Home Network Setups

### Example 1: Basic Home Network with VLANs

- **Setup**: Create VLANs for different device categories (e.g., smartphones, laptops, smart TVs).
- **Configuration**:
  - VLAN 10 for smartphones
  - VLAN 20 for laptops and PCs
  - VLAN 30 for smart TVs

### Example 2: Home Network with QoS

- **Setup**: Create VLANs and configure QoS to prioritize traffic for video streaming and gaming.
- **Configuration**:
  - VLAN 10 for smartphones
  - VLAN 20 for laptops and PCs
  - VLAN 30 for smart TVs
  - QoS policy to prioritize traffic on VLAN 30

### Example 3: Secure Home Network

- **Setup**: Create VLANs and implement firewall rules and ACLs for enhanced security.
- **Configuration**:
  - VLAN 10 for smartphones
  - VLAN 20 for laptops and PCs
  - VLAN 30 for smart TVs
  - Firewall rules to restrict traffic between VLANs
  - ACLs to control access to sensitive devices

## Optimizing OVS for Specific Use Cases

### Use Case 1: High-Performance Gaming Network

- **Setup**: Create a dedicated VLAN for gaming devices and configure QoS for low latency.
- **Configuration**:
  - VLAN 40 for gaming PCs and consoles
  - QoS policy to prioritize gaming traffic

### Use Case 2: Smart Home Network

- **Setup**: Create VLANs for smart home devices and secure them with ACLs.
- **Configuration**:
  - VLAN 50 for smart home devices
  - ACLs to restrict access to the internet and other VLANs

## Real-World Scenarios and Best Practices

### Scenario 1: Handling Network Congestion

- **Problem**: Network congestion during peak hours.
- **Solution**: Implement QoS policies to prioritize critical traffic and limit bandwidth for non-essential devices.

### Scenario 2: Enhancing Network Security

- **Problem**: Unauthorized access to network resources.
- **Solution**: Use VLANs, firewall rules, and ACLs to segment the network and control access.

### Best Practices

- Regularly update OVS and system software.
- Monitor network performance and logs.
- Implement security measures to protect your network.

By following these case studies and examples, you can optimize your OVS-based home network for various use cases and scenarios.
