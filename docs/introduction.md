# Introduction

Welcome to the Open vSwitch (OVS) Home Setup guide. This repository provides comprehensive instructions on setting up and configuring OVS for a home network. The goal is to create a segmented, secure, and efficient network using OVS, tailored to various devices and use cases.

## What is Open vSwitch (OVS)?

Open vSwitch (OVS) is a multilayer virtual switch designed to enable network automation while supporting standard management interfaces and protocols. It provides features like VLAN tagging, QoS, and flow-based traffic management.

## Benefits of Using OVS in a Home Network

- **Network Segmentation**: Create VLANs to isolate different types of devices.
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Manage bandwidth allocation to ensure optimal performance.
- **Security**: Implement security measures to protect your network.

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Provide step-by-step setup instructions for OVS using various methods.
- Demonstrate VLAN creation and management for different device categories.
- Explain how to configure QoS and enhance network security.
- Offer troubleshooting tips and advanced configurations.

## Setup Options

This guide covers three different setup options:
1. VirtualBox setup
2. Native OVS setup on an old PC or laptop
3. Hardware switch setup using Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch

Follow the setup option that best suits your needs and available resources.
