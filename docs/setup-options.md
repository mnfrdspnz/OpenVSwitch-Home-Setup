# Setup Options

This guide provides three different setup options for configuring Open vSwitch (OVS) in a home network:

## Option 1: VirtualBox Setup

Hosting OVS in a VirtualBox VM is a cost-effective way to get started without requiring dedicated hardware. This setup is ideal for those who want to experiment with OVS and learn its features.

## Option 2: Native OVS Setup

Installing OVS on an old PC or laptop allows you to utilize existing hardware. This setup provides better performance than a virtual machine and can handle more traffic.

## Option 3: Hardware Switch Setup

Using a switch that supports OVS, such as the Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch, offers a robust and professional-grade solution. This setup is ideal for those who want a dedicated switch with advanced features and better performance.
